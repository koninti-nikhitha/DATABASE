SELECT
  score,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY score DESC) AS `rank`
FROM Scores
ORDER BY score DESC;


DENSE_RANK is a SQL window function that assigns rankings to rows without skipping numbers when there are ties.
Think of it like handing out medals:

If two people tie for first place, they both get rank 1.
The next person is rank 2 (not 3), because we don’t leave a “hole” after the tie.
